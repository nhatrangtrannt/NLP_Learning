This notebook is where I practice NLP with the topics as below:

1. **Text Processing using nltk and spaCy**
    - Given the news article
    - Detect sentences, tokenize each sentence, perform POS, and find name entities

2. **Text classification using Weka**
    - Given training set and testing set in an arff format
    - The arff files already removed stop words and stemming words
    - Pick classifiers of your choice to conduct text classification
